# CyberKhana CTF — Challenge List

## 1. What Am I?
**File:** `suspicious.pdf`
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Points:** 50
**Flag:** `khana{f1l3_typ3s_c4nt_h1d3}`

We intercepted a document from a suspect's machine.
Our analyst says it's a PDF, but it won't open in any reader.
Something about this file isn't what it seems...
Can you figure out what it really is and find the hidden flag?

## 2. Carved
**File:** `linus.jpg`
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Points:** 75
**Flag:** `khana{b1nw4lk_c4rv3s_s3cr3ts}`

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code." — Linus Torvalds
Linus left us a message, but it's not in the pixels.
There's more to this image than meets the eye.
Look beyond what image viewers show you.

## 3. Pixel Secrets
**File:** `creation.png`
**Difficulty:** Easy | **Points:** 150
**Flag:** `khana{z5t3g_p1x3l_m4st3r}`

Every pixel tells a story. Some tell secrets.
This image looks completely normal — no weird extensions,
no extra files hiding inside. But the secret is woven
into the very fabric of the image itself.
You'll need a tool that can see what the human eye can't.

## 4. Layers
**File:** `gamer_cat.jpg`
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Points:** 300
**Flag:** `khana{l4y3r3d_f0r3ns1cs_pr0}`

This cat is hiding something. Actually, multiple somethings.
Like an onion (or an ogre), this file has layers.
Each layer you peel back reveals a clue for the next.
Hint: Sometimes things are rotated.

## 5. Deep Cave
**File:** `deep_cave.jpg`
**Difficulty:** Hard | **Points:** 500
**Flag:** `khana{d33p_c4v3_expl0r3r}`

You found this image on an old hard drive buried in a Minecraft world backup. Whoever left it behind covered their tracks — wiped files, scrubbed data, erased every trace. But they made one mistake. Nothing is ever truly deleted. Dig deep enough and you'll find what they tried to hide.

## 6. Never Gonna Give You Up
**File:** `rickroll.wav`
**Difficulty:** Medium | **Points:** 250
**Flag:** `khana{sp3ctr0gr4m_r1ckr0ll}`

We intercepted an audio transmission from a suspect's burner phone. At first it just sounds like a familiar song — but our analysts believe there's more to it than meets the ear. Sometimes secrets hide in frequencies humans can't hear. You'll need to see the sound, not just listen to it.
